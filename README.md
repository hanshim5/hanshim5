🎓 Senior at CSULB, studying Computer Science  
🔭 Aspiring Data Analyst and Big Data Enthusiast  

I’m a Computer Science student at CSULB with a passion for data engineering, machine learning, and backend development. I enjoy building tools that make data more accessible, trustworthy, and impactful, whether it’s tracking model confidence or improving campus safety through web apps.  

🔧 I’ve worked with tools like Python, SQL, MongoDB, and React, and recently explored model observability and LLM tracing during my internship at 113 Industries. I’m also a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, where I’ve been applying ML techniques to real-world projects.  

I’m always learning and always open to collaborating on meaningful tech.  


#**🛠 Tech Stack:**  
Programming Languages: Python, Javascript, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Libraries & Frameworks: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, spaCy, Node.js, Next.js  
Databases: SQL, MySQL  
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab  
Version Control: Git, GitHub   

#**🚀 Projects:**  
A few other noteworthy projects I’ve worked on:  

1. Association Rule Mining for Diabetes Risk Factors  
Check out my work on this data mining project using association rule mining to uncover relationships between health indicators in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. My teammate and I analyzed survey data from the CDC to support early risk detection and preventative care strategies.  

Tools: Python, pandas, mlxtend, Apriori algorithm  
What We Did: Preprocessed the dataset using one-hot encoding and binning, then applied the Apriori algorithm to identify common co-occurrences of symptoms and health factors (Ex. high blood pressure, cholesterol, and difficulty walking) in both diabetic and prediabetic groups.
Results: Uncovered strong associations—like difficulty walking correlating with poor general health (Lift = 2.79)—that could inform preventative outreach and treatment plans. We visualized itemsets as node-edge graphs to communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

2. Sentiment Classification on Book Reviews  
This project tackles the task of automatically classifying whether a book review is positive or negative using NLP techniques. I followed the full ML lifecycle, from exploratory analysis to modeling and evaluation—on a dataset of 1,800+ user submitted book reviews.  

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression  
What We Did: Vectorized text using TF-IDF with unigrams and bigrams, trained a logistic regression model, and fine-tuned it using GridSearchCV. Evaluated results with precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix for performance insights.
Results: Achieved 82% accuracy, with balanced performance across both positive and negative classes. The final model showed strong generalization and interpretability, demonstrating that even simple linear models can effectively handle sentiment analysis with the right preprocessing.

3. Safety Shark – CSULB Campus Incident Reporting Map  
Check out our interactive web app built to help CSULB students report and stay informed about safety incidents on campus. Inspired by real posts on the CSULB subreddit, our team designed a map-based tool that empowers students to identify potential danger zones and promote campus safety through community awareness.  

🛠 Tools: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Google Maps API  
🔍 What We Did: Built a dynamic interface allowing users to report incidents by placing markers on a campus map, including custom titles, descriptions, and images. Integrated Google Maps API for real-time location data and used state management with React Hooks to handle marker and sidebar interactions.  
📊 Results: Created a fully functional MVP with live incident tracking and clickable markers. Improved accessibility of safety info for CSULB students and plan to pitch the app to CSULB for potential adoption.

#**✨ Fun Fact:**  
A freshly sharpened pencil is my favorite partner! You’ll usually find me solving logic puzzles for fun, scheming my next escape room strategy, or breaking down tough concepts while tutoring students (bonus points if they leave smiling and a little more confident).
